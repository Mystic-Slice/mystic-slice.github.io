Hi! I'm Ashwath, a graduate student in the Master of Science in Computer Science program with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My passion lies in understanding and building AI systems, with a particular focus on explainability and safe of these systems.

My journey has led me from competitive programming, app development, and web development to deep learning in computer vision, and now to the broader field of AI. I'm excited about the potential of AI integration in software products and aim to build a career as an AI/ML engineer or AI-focused software developer.

I'm an enthusiastic open-source contributor. I participated in the Google Summer of Code 2021 where I worked with MuseScore. I have also worked on Heat, a distributed high-performance computation library.

Always eager to explore new technologies, I've recently been exploring frameworks like LangChain for building AI integrated software products. If you share similar interests or just want to chat about AI and tech, feel free to reach out! :)
