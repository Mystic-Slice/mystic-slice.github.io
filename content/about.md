Hi! I'm Ashwath, a Computer Science student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I am interested in Deep Learning. My current research is focused on the application of Deep Learning in Computer Vision.

I used to be really into competitive programming, but I've since shifted my focus to other areas of interest. I am always eager to explore new technologies and concepts. I have recently been learning a little bit of Rust programming.

I am really enthusiastic about open-source development. I got to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021 and contributed to the MuseScore project. Right now, I am working on [Heat](https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat), a distributed high-performance computation library.

If you share my interests or just want to talk, please feel free to reach out to me. :)
